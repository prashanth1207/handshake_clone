Having worked in technology for a long time, I realize the positive impact it can have on people’s lives and want to contribute to society through technology. Professionally, I have worked on several projects at Rochester Institute of Technology, developing and deploying web applications. These projects allowed me to demonstrate my skills in front-end web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I feel that this, along with my previous industry work experience of 4+ years, makes me well suited to work in teams that develop web applications. I am also working as a graduate assistant, assisting my professor on his research on software process improvement frameworks for scientific community who often create customized software for their scientific experiments. I am currently looking for full time positions using my software engineering front end skills. I am available from August 2019 and I look forward to working with you on my next big project.","phoneNumber":"123-456-7891","dob":"2020-02-18","createdAt":"2020-02-18T04:24:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-11T19:32:46.000Z","userId":10}}');
